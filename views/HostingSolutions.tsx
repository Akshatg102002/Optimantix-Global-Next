  const faqs = [
    { q: "What is VPS Hosting?", a: "A Virtual Private Server (VPS) gives you dedicated CPU, RAM, and storage within a shared physical machine. Unlike shared hosting, your allocated resources are guaranteed — your performance is consistent and unaffected by other users on the same server." },
    { q: "What is Cloud Hosting?", a: "Cloud hosting uses a network of distributed virtual and physical servers to host websites and applications. Unlike traditional hosting on a single server, cloud hosting distributes your workload across multiple nodes — delivering better reliability, scalability, and uptime." },
    { q: "How is Cloud Hosting different from VPS Hosting?", a: "VPS hosting gives you fixed, dedicated resources on a single virtual server — ideal for stable, predictable workloads. Cloud hosting provides dynamic, auto-scalable resources distributed across multiple servers, with a higher 99.99% uptime SLA — better suited for applications with unpredictable traffic." },
    { q: "Which operating systems can I install?", a: "You can choose from popular Linux distributions including Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian, or opt for Windows Server. You have full root access to configure the OS exactly as your project requires." },
    { q: "Do all plans include a free SSL certificate?", a: "Yes. Every hosting plan from Optimantix includes a free SSL certificate, which enables HTTPS on your website. This is essential for security, SEO rankings, and visitor trust." },
    { q: "Can I migrate my existing website to Optimantix for free?", a: "Yes. We provide free website migration for all new customers. Our team handles the full transfer of your website files, databases, and emails — with minimal to zero downtime." },
    { q: "Is GST charged on hosting plans?", a: "Yes. All prices listed are exclusive of 18% GST. We issue GST-compliant invoices for ITC claims." },
    { q: "Can I upgrade my hosting plan later?", a: "Absolutely. You can upgrade your plan at any time as your website grows. Upgrades are applied instantly and prorated to your billing cycle." },
