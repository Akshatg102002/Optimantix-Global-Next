            {
              "question": "What's the minimum budget you work with?",
              "answer": "We work with ad spends starting from ₹50,000/month on Google and ₹30,000/month on Meta. Below these thresholds, the data volume is too thin for meaningful optimisation — and we'd rather tell you that upfront than take your money and underdeliver. Our Google ads service sweet spot is ₹1L–₹10L+ monthly, where the full impact of our strategy becomes measurable."
            },
            {
              "question": "How quickly can I expect results?",
              "answer": "Google Search typically shows meaningful improvement within 3–4 weeks as bidding algorithms learn and we refine early data. Meta campaigns usually need 4–6 weeks to exit the learning phase and stabilise. ROAS improvements of 30–60% within 90 days are normal for accounts we take over from underperforming agencies — and we document every change with date-stamped data so the improvement is traceable."
            },
            {
              "question": "Do you charge a percentage of ad spend or a flat fee?",
              "answer": "Flat monthly retainer — not a percentage of spend. This matters because percentage-of-spend creates a conflict of interest where we'd benefit from recommending higher budgets regardless of performance. Our fee covers strategy, setup, weekly optimisation, creative consultation, and monthly reporting. Ad spend goes directly to Google or Meta from your own accounts — we never hold your media budget."
            },
            {
              "question": "Can you handle both Google and Meta simultaneously?",
              "answer": "Yes — and we handle them together, which is the point. Most brands get the highest returns from a coordinated approach where Google captures demand and Meta builds it. Our cross-channel attribution setup shows how each platform contributes to the same conversion path, not just siloed platform-reported numbers that always look impressive in isolation."

            {
              "question": "What makes Optimantix different from other PPC agencies?",

Creative and media buying are inseparable in our model because creative is the biggest performance lever on Meta and YouTube."

            {
              "question": "How soon will I start seeing results from social media marketing?",
              "answer": "Honestly — it depends on your starting point and goals. Paid social campaigns can generate leads within the first week. Organic growth through content and community building typically shows meaningful traction within 60 to 90 days. We set realistic milestones at the start of every engagement so you always know what to expect and when."
            },
            {
              "question": "Do I need to be active on every platform?",
              "answer": "Almost never. The right platforms depend entirely on where your audience actually spends time. A B2B company gets far more value from LinkedIn than TikTok. A real estate brand performs better on Instagram and Facebook than Twitter. We help you identify the two or three platforms worth investing in and focus your entire effort there — not spread thin everywhere."
            },
            {
              "question": "What's the difference between social media management and social media marketing?",
              "answer": "Social media management typically covers the ongoing operational work — scheduling posts, responding to comments, maintaining your presence. Social media marketing is the broader strategic layer — campaign planning, paid advertising, audience growth, and conversion strategy. Our service covers both, fully integrated under one roof. If you want to see everything we offer beyond social, explore our full digital marketing services — from SEO and paid search to branding and marketplace management.",

              "question": "Can you handle social media marketing for a real estate business specifically?",
              "answer": "Yes — and it's one of our strongest verticals. Real estate social media marketing has its own set of challenges: long buyer journeys, high-value transactions, and audiences that need to trust you before they ever pick up the phone. We create content and campaigns specifically designed to build that trust and generate qualified property enquiries."
            },
            {
              "question": "How does your social media marketing for startups differ from what you do for larger brands?",
              "answer": "Startups usually need maximum impact with lean budgets and fast turnarounds. We focus on building a sharp brand identity from scratch, choosing the right one or two platforms to dominate early, and creating content that establishes credibility quickly. There's less process overhead and more agility — we move at startup speed and adjust strategy as you grow."
            },
            {
              "question": "Will I have any say in the content before it goes live?",
              "answer": "Absolutely. Every client gets a shared monthly content calendar before anything goes live. You review and approve posts, suggest changes, and give feedback before publication. We have a clear process for this that keeps things moving without requiring you to be available 24/7."
            },
            {
              "question": "Is there a minimum contract period?",
              "answer": "We work on a monthly rolling basis — no long lock-in contracts. That said, social media results compound over time, and most clients see the best ROI after three to six months of consistent work. We'd rather earn your business every month with results than hold you to a contract."

              "question": "Do I need to give you access to my Seller Central account?",
              "answer": "Yes — we work directly inside your account using Amazon's user permissions system. This means we're added as a secondary user under your account, so you always retain full ownership and visibility. You can revoke access at any time, though in practice our clients never feel the need to."

              "question": "How quickly can I expect to see results from amazon seller central management?",

Revenue and ranking improvements compound over 60–90 days as Amazon's algorithm picks up the stronger signals. We set honest expectations upfront: meaningful growth takes at least 90 days to play out properly."

              "question": "What makes you different from other Amazon management agencies?",

We've also built internal tooling that catches listing suppressions, review patterns, and competitor moves faster than most agencies do manually."

That said, we do ask for at least 90 days to show meaningful results — Amazon's algorithm needs that runway to respond to optimisations. Most clients stay with us well beyond that simply because the results keep improving."

              "answer": "It's a comprehensive managed service — listing creation and optimisation, Flipkart Ads campaign management, pricing strategy, inventory and fulfilment monitoring, return rate reduction, customer feedback management, quality score improvement, and weekly performance reporting. Essentially, if it lives inside your Flipkart seller panel, we handle it. You get one accountable team for everything, not fragmented advice from multiple sources."
            },
            {
              "question": "How do you access my Flipkart seller account?",
              "answer": "We use Flipkart's official sub-user or authorised access mechanism, which means you add us as a secondary user on your account. You retain complete ownership and can remove our access at any point. All activity we perform is visible in your account history — there's no black box. Transparency is something we take seriously, not just something we say."
            },
            {
              "question": "How long before I see results from Flipkart account management?",
              "answer": "Some changes show results quickly — quality score improvements, ad waste reduction, and listing click-through rate lifts often move within the first 30 days. Meaningful ranking and revenue growth typically compounds over 60–90 days as Flipkart's algorithm responds to consistent signals. We're upfront about this timeline from day one. Anyone promising dramatic results in two weeks is overselling."
            },
            {
              "question": "Do you work with sellers across all Flipkart categories?",
              "answer": "Yes — we've worked across fashion, electronics, home & kitchen, personal care, FMCG, sports, and more. That said, we don't stretch a single manager across every category. We match your account to a manager who has direct experience in your specific vertical. Category knowledge on Flipkart matters more than most sellers realise — the ranking signals, pricing sensitivity, and quality parameters differ significantly between, say, apparel and electronics."
            },
            {
              "question": "We also sell on other marketplaces — can you manage those too?",
              "answer": "Absolutely. While this page focuses on Flipkart, we manage seller accounts across multiple platforms. If you want a single team handling your entire marketplace presence, our end-to-end marketplace management services cover Amazon, Meesho, Myntra, and more — all under the same dedicated account management model.",

              "question": "Is there a minimum commitment period?",
              "answer": "We work month-to-month with no mandatory long-term contracts. We do recommend a minimum 90-day engagement to give optimisations time to play out — Flipkart's algorithm needs that runway to reflect changes in listings and ad performance. But there's no clause trapping you in. Clients stay because results keep building, and that's the only reason we want."
            },
            {
              "question": "What does communication and reporting look like?",
              "answer": "You get a dedicated account manager as your single point of contact — not a rotating support team. Weekly reports cover quality scores, ad performance, sell-through rates, return trends, and any issues flagged. Monthly strategy calls review what's working, what's changing on the platform, and what's next. For anything urgent — a listing removal, a policy notice, an unexpected traffic drop — we reach out to you immediately rather than waiting for a scheduled call."

Meaningful revenue growth and rating improvements compound over 60–90 days. We set these expectations upfront, clearly, before you sign anything. Anyone promising dramatic sales inside two weeks on Nykaa is telling you what you want to hear, not what the platform's algorithm actually allows."

Amazon rewards discoverability and price; Nykaa rewards brand trust, content quality, and ingredient credibility. The strategies that work well on general marketplaces rarely transfer cleanly to a premium beauty platform. We see this mistake regularly — brands bringing a general marketplace playbook to Nykaa and wondering why they're not converting. If you want a single team managing your full marketplace presence, our complete marketplace management services cover Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, and more under one coordinated strategy.",

We do ask for 90 days to show meaningful results — the Nykaa algorithm and review accumulation both need that runway. But nothing binds you beyond that. The reason clients stay well past three months is that the compounding results make it an obvious decision, not because a contract requires it."

By month four our GMV had grown 2.6x and we were consistently in the top three slots for our category in six key pin codes. The difference between managing it yourself and having specialists do it is enormous.",

We execute the work, not just advise on it."

              "question": "What documentation is needed to get listed on Blinkit and Zepto?",
              "answer": "At minimum: GST registration, FSSAI licence (for food and beverage products), brand trademark or authorisation letter, product MRP declarations, and category-specific compliance certifications. Requirements vary by product type — packaged food, personal care, and household products each have different compliance thresholds. We handle the full documentation audit and submission process so nothing delays your go-live."

            {
              "question": "How is quick commerce different from managing an Amazon or Flipkart account?",
              "answer": "Fundamentally different. On Amazon or Flipkart, inventory sits in a central warehouse and orders ship within 1–2 days. On Blinkit and Zepto, your stock needs to be physically present in dozens of dark stores across specific pin codes — and if a single dark store runs out, your ranking drops immediately. The advertising ecosystem, inventory logic, fill rate compliance, and pricing dynamics are all distinct. Brands that treat q-comm like a standard marketplace consistently underperform."
            },
            {
              "question": "Do you manage both Blinkit and Zepto together?",
              "answer": "Yes — and managing them together is where the real efficiency comes from. Both platforms require similar compliance and listing work but have distinct ad systems, inventory thresholds, and category approval processes. We run a unified strategy across both, coordinate replenishments to shared dark store zones where possible, and give you one consolidated performance view rather than two separate silos to manage."
            },
            {
              "question": "How quickly will I see results?",
              "answer": "Listing corrections and fill rate improvements typically show within 2–4 weeks. Meaningful GMV growth and ranking improvements compound over 60–90 days as the platform algorithm picks up consistent in-stock and sales signals. We set honest expectations upfront before you commit to anything. Quick commerce rewards consistency — there are no overnight miracles, but the compounding effect is real and measurable."
            },
            {
              "question": "We already sell on Amazon and Flipkart — do you manage those too?",

We do recommend a minimum 90-day engagement — dark store coverage and algorithm signals need that runway to compound properly. But nothing binds you beyond that. Clients stay because the GMV keeps growing, not because a contract requires it."

We'd been selling on Meesho for over a year with around 200 orders a month and couldn't figure out why we weren't growing. Turns out our listing attributes were wrong for almost 60% of our products. They fixed everything in three weeks and within two months we were doing over 650 orders a month. The return rate also dropped from 24% to under 10%, which made a bigger difference to our actual take-home than the extra orders did.",

It's a genuine end-to-end managed service, not a consulting retainer where you do the execution yourself."
            },
            {
              "question": "Why does Meesho specifically need a different approach to other marketplaces?",
              "answer": "A few reasons. Meesho shoppers are significantly more price-sensitive than Amazon or Flipkart customers, so pricing strategy works differently. The catalogue quality score system heavily influences visibility — and it rewards correctly attributed products, not keyword stuffing. Returns are weighted more aggressively in Meesho's seller ranking. And the ad system requires a different optimisation logic because cost-per-order economics are tighter. Sellers who apply an Amazon playbook to Meesho usually end up frustrated."
            },
            {
              "question": "How soon will I see results after you take over my account?",
              "answer": "Some improvements come quickly — catalogue quality score corrections, pricing alignment, and suppressed listing fixes can show visible movement within 2–3 weeks. Meaningful order volume growth typically shows up between 30–60 days. Return rate improvements usually appear in the 30–45 day window once corrected listings have enough order data. We set honest expectations at the start — not inflated ones just to close a deal."
            },
            {
              "question": "Do I need to give you direct access to my Meesho seller account?",
              "answer": "Yes — we work directly inside your account through Meesho's authorised sub-user access. You retain full ownership and admin control at all times and can revoke access whenever you choose. Every action we take is logged and visible in your account. There's no black-box activity — complete transparency throughout."

            {
              "question": "Do you manage other marketplaces too — can you handle everything together?",

If you're selling across Amazon, Flipkart, or other channels, our complete multi-marketplace management services let a single dedicated team handle your entire online marketplace presence under one coordinated strategy — so your catalogues, pricing, and brand identity stay consistent everywhere.",

              "answer": "We work month-to-month with no mandatory long-term contracts. We do ask for at least 90 days to produce meaningful results — the algorithm needs time to respond and listing improvements need data to validate. But nothing binds you beyond that. Clients typically stay well past 90 days because the results keep compounding, not because they have to."

Weekly reports cover catalogue health, order volumes, return trends, ad performance, and any flagged issues — in plain language, not raw data. Monthly strategy calls review what's working and what's coming. For anything urgent — a penalty, a bulk suppression, a sudden traffic drop — we reach out immediately rather than waiting for the next scheduled update."

Category-specific requirements apply — apparel needs size charts and fabric composition data, footwear needs last measurements, and accessories need material and care specifications.

              "question": "How is managing Myntra different from Amazon or Flipkart?",

Product imagery is held to a much higher standard — consistent white backgrounds, specific model photography requirements, and style editorial standards. The buyer is fashion-literate and more likely to return products due to fit or styling issues than on general marketplaces, which means return rate management is more critical here. And Myntra's sale events — EORS, Big Fashion Festival — require strategic planning months in advance. Brands that bring a general marketplace approach to Myntra consistently underperform."

            {
              "question": "How quickly will I see results?",
              "answer": "Catalogue corrections and suppressed style reinstatements typically show within 2–3 weeks. Return rate improvements appear in the 30–45 day window as corrected content accumulates real order data. Meaningful GMV and ranking improvements compound over 60–90 days. We set these expectations clearly before you sign anything — no inflated promises to close a deal."

End of Reason Sale and Big Fashion Festival require inventory planning, discount structure decisions, ad budget scaling, and content readiness checks weeks in advance. We manage the full preparation and execution cycle so your brand is positioned to capture maximum sale-day volume without margin errors or stock gaps."

              "question": "How much does it cost to build an ecommerce store with Optimantix?",
              "answer": "Cost depends on the scope, platform, and complexity of your store. A Shopify store with a custom theme, 3–5 integrations, and up to 500 products typically starts from ₹1.5 lakh. A fully custom headless storefront with complex ERP integration and multi-warehouse logic starts from ₹6 lakh+. We always provide a detailed proposal with itemised estimates before any commitment — no vague quotes, no hidden costs."

            {
              "question": "How long does a typical ecommerce build take?",
              "answer": "A standard Shopify store with a custom theme takes 6–8 weeks from signed brief to launch. More complex builds — custom development, platform migrations, or enterprise integrations — typically run 10–16 weeks. We share a detailed project timeline in the proposal stage so you know exactly what to expect from day one."

              "question": "Do you only build on Shopify, or can you work with other platforms?",
              "answer": "We work across Shopify, Shopify Plus, WooCommerce, Magento / Adobe Commerce, and fully custom headless architectures. Shopify is what we recommend most often for DTC brands — but we'll always recommend the platform that genuinely fits your business, not the one that's easiest for us to build."

            {
              "question": "Can you migrate my existing store without losing SEO rankings?",
              "answer": "Yes — and we take this seriously. Our migration process includes a full URL audit, 301 redirect mapping, structured data preservation, canonical tag management, and post-launch monitoring for any ranking fluctuations. Most clients see no meaningful drop in organic traffic, and many see improvements once we resolve the technical SEO debt accumulated in their old store."

A lot of our clients stay with us for years because having a team that already knows your codebase is genuinely valuable."

              "question": "How long does a typical WordPress project take?",
              "answer": "It really depends on scope. A clean, focused business site typically takes 3–5 weeks from kickoff to launch. A custom WooCommerce store with complex product logic, payment integrations, and custom features usually runs 6–10 weeks. We give you a detailed timeline at the start — and we stick to it."
            },
            {
              "question": "Do you only do WordPress, or do you handle other development services too?",
              "answer": "WordPress is our primary focus, but we operate within a broader development ecosystem. If you need landing pages, custom web applications, or full-stack integrations alongside your WordPress build, our team can handle that too. You can explore our full web and software development services to see the complete picture of what we offer.",

              "question": "Will I be able to manage the website myself after it's built?",
              "answer": "Absolutely — that's a priority for us. We build with clean Gutenberg blocks and intuitive page builder setups so that you (or anyone on your team) can update content, add blog posts, or manage products without touching a line of code. We also provide handover documentation and a walkthrough session before you go live."

              "question": "What makes Optimantix different from a freelancer or a cheaper agency?",
              "answer": "A freelancer gives you a single point of failure. A cheap agency cuts corners you won't notice until six months after launch when your site breaks or Google stops ranking you. Optimantix brings a full team — designers, developers, and strategists — working in sync, with real QA processes and long-term support baked in. We're not the cheapest option. But we're the one that delivers."

We offer managed hosting on high-performance servers, plus monthly maintenance plans that include security updates, plugin management, backups, uptime monitoring, and priority support. Think of it as a retainer for peace of mind — your site stays healthy so you can focus on growing your business."

We'll ask the deeper questions during the discovery phase and guide you through everything else. The first step is just reaching out — no lengthy brief required."

              "answer": "The short version: ownership and control. Page builders give you a site built on top of someone else's foundation. Custom development means your website is your intellectual property, written for your exact requirements. It's faster, more secure, more scalable, and completely differentiated."
            },
            {
              "question": "How much does a custom website typically cost?",
              "answer": "It depends heavily on scope, functionality, and complexity. A focused custom marketing site might start from £8,000–£15,000. A full eCommerce platform or web application is typically £20,000–£60,000+. We scope each project individually and give you a detailed, transparent proposal."

            {
              "question": "How long does a custom web development project take?",
              "answer": "For a well-scoped marketing or brochure site, typically 5–8 weeks. Complex platforms, eCommerce builds, or applications with custom back-end logic usually take 10–18 weeks depending on scope and feedback cycles."

              "answer": "Yes — 100%. Upon final payment, full intellectual property and copyright of the logo transfers to you. There are no licensing fees, no usage restrictions, and no ongoing payments. It's your logo, for life. We also provide documentation confirming the IP transfer if you need it for legal or trademark purposes."

              "question": "What if I don't like any of the initial concepts?",
              "answer": "It rarely happens, but if none of the initial directions feel right, we go back to the drawing board. We take this as a signal to revisit the brief together and understand more about what's missing. Every project includes a defined number of revision rounds, and in practice, most clients are making refinements rather than wholesale changes by the time concepts are presented."

              "answer": "Absolutely. A lot of clients start with our Essential or Professional packages and decide they want the full brand identity system as they go. We can upgrade your project at any point and simply charge the difference. There's no penalty and no wasted work — everything transfers across."
            },
            {
              "question": "Do you work with startups that have a limited budget?",
              "answer": "Yes — our Essential package at $349 is specifically designed to give early-stage businesses access to professional, strategic logo design without breaking the bank. We also offer flexible payment plans on higher-tier projects, so reach out and let's have a conversation about what works for your situation."

              "question": "What makes Optimantix different from using a freelancer or a design platform?",
              "answer": "Freelancers can be great, but you're often working with one person juggling multiple projects and limited by their own style. Design platforms produce templated results that your competitors could be using too. At Optimantix, you get a dedicated senior creative working within a structured process, with brand strategy baked in from the start. It's the difference between a logo that looks nice and a logo that actually builds your brand."
